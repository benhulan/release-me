# Release Me

This is a demo app using Node and Express. Users can enter the current mileage, target mileage and end date of their leased vehicle and determine whether they are on-track to avoid balloon payments at the end.

The second feature uses Google Maps API to calculate their daily commute, setting aside those miles.

Future features would definitely include a database with users and autos.
It would also include a trip planner to plan long road-trips.

Enjoy!
